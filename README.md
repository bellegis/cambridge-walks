## About
I want to walk down every street in Cambridge. 

This is an archive of the data for the [map I use while I'm walking](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=13n9MBsS9eZRBMQj9FqgRguUqnCrLAQcW&usp=sharing).

## Workflow

I track the walks in an app called EasyTrails, which lets you upload the .gpx files. I then inport those files into QGIS to do some cleaning that I am particular about. Then I upload the data to Google MyMaps and plop my past routes on top of a layer showing every street maintained by the City of Cambridge. This helps me when I am on the go to figure out where I have gone before and where I want to go next using regular Google Maps app on my phone, which lets you display your MyMaps within the normal GoogleMaps interface showing your current location. 

It's fun!
